# ChatDock

A minimal, floating, always-on-top AI chat interface designed to live on your desktop and stay out of the way while you work. Summon it via keyboard shortcut and fire off questions or commands directly to a local or cloud-based AI ‚Äî without switching windows.

The long-term goal is to run this chat bar fully locally using tools like [Ollama](https://ollama.com), with zero cloud dependencies ‚Äî just fast, private AI access baked into the OS.
